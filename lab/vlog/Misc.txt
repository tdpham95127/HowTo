    micro-architecture ??? what does it mean?
    fifo design 
     
    some logic design problems:
	*recursive 
        *fibonacci sequence
        *tracking the 2nd largest		
    

5, Computer 
    Look-ahead adder
    Booth multiplier
    CPU design
       Cache
       Instruction fetch
       Instruction decode
       memory access/ Branch completion
       Write back
       Structural: some combination of instructions cannot be accommodate because of resource conflicts
              * Data -- occurs when 
                        Read after Write
                        Write after Write
                        Write after Read
              * Control -- Branch may or may not jump to new program counter 
      
    memory system/ Cache
      * Register
      * Cache
          * L1D, L1I -- per core data and instruction
          * L2(L3) -- mid-level
          * LLC -- fronts DRAM
      * Main Memory 
          * DRAM 
          * Virtual memory
              divides physical address into blocks and allocates them to difference processes. Inherent to such an approach must be a protection scheme that restricts a process to the blocks belongs only to it.
      * Other
